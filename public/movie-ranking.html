<h2>My Top 3 Movies Of All-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Fair Play</h3>
<p>Highlights the volatility of the male ego in relationships. An eye-opener for all modern women as it addresses a silent enemy for all high-achieving women in relationship.</p>

<h3>Grown-Ups (1&2)</h3>
<p>The best comedy movie, in my opinion. Great actors. Puts forward the message of friendship and it's importance in life.</p>

<h3>Anyone But You</h3>
<p>A wonderfully romantic comedy. A great watch for any day.</p>
